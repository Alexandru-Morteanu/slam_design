            <p className="text-lg">
              3D printing is a process of making three-dimensional solid objects
              from a digital file. It allows you to create objects layer by
              layer, making it a great choice for custom designs, prototypes,
              and complex geometries.

              How long does it take to complete an order?
            </h3>
            <p className="text-lg">
              The time required for printing depends on the complexity and size
              of the object. On average, a typical print can take between 3 to
              24 hours, but we always strive to meet your deadlines.

            </h3>
            <p className="text-lg">
              Once an order is placed, it enters our processing queue. However,
              if you need to make a change, please contact us immediately, and
              we will do our best to accommodate your request before printing
              begins.
